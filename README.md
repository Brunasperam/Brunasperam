**Additional Information**


I'm passionate about creating a warm and inviting atmosphere in my home through interior design.  When I'm not working, you'll find me getting creative with DIY projects – I love designing and painting wall murals, and I enjoy crafting macrame pieces for myself and my friends. 

Learning is always a priority for me, and I'm currently setting my sights on mastering the beautiful Italian language.  Spending time outdoors is essential for me to recharge. Whether it's soaking up the sun at the beach, exploring new trails on a hike, or venturing out to experience different cultures through travel, I'm always up for an adventure!
